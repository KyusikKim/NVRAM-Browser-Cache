<p class="centerAlign"><img src="images/qt-embedded-architecture.png" /></p><p>Currently, three embedded platforms are supported by Qt:</p>

<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td ><a href="qt-embedded-linux.html">Qt for Embedded Linux</a> is designed to be used on Linux devices without X11 or existing graphical environments. This flavor of Qt includes a framework for creating both applications and an environment for them. As a result, it includes features for window management, inter-process communication and facilities for handling input and display devices.</td><td ><a href="qtce.html">Qt for Windows CE</a> is used to create applications running in existing Windows CE and Windows Mobile environments. Applications use the appropriate style for the embedded environment and use native features, such as menus, to conform to the native style guidelines.</td><td ><a href="qtsymbian.html">Qt for the Symbian platform</a> is used to create applications running in existing Symbian platform environments. Applications use the appropriate style for the embedded environment and use native features, such as menus, to conform to the native style guidelines.</td></tr>
